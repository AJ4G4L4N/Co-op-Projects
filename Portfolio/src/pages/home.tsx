        tech industry. Currently engaged in a co-op position, I am gaining
        valuable hands-on experience and contributing to real-world projects.

        With a strong foundation in programming, I am eager to explore new
        challenges and apply my knowledge in a professional setting. As a

        skills, and a commitment to continuous learning to any team or project.
